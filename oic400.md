# **Lab 400 - Add Visual Builder Cloud Service (VBCS) Web Application to Call OIC REST API**

## **Introduction**

This is the fourth of several labs that are part of the **OIC Development** workshop.

In this lab, you will create a VBCS Web Application which calls the REST end-point created in the previous Lab 300.

The image below depicts the completed VBCS Web Application UI:

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image000_001.png)

This web application will use a form to call a REST service (post/orders). The form will submit an order and has required validations for fields (mandatory, number range, etc). Also, a custom validation for the entire form before submitting it (using a button) will be built. The order status is returned to the web application.

## **Objectives**

- Learn how to create a VBCS web application
- Learn how to create form validations, business objects and modify source code
- Learn to change design views and use live mode to create/test data
- Learn how to write custom form validations

## **Pre-Requisites**
- **REQUIRED:** 
    - This lab assumes that you have already completed [Lab 300B](/oic 300b.md)

  > - `price` ---> `orderInfo/UnitPrice`  
  > - `shipTo` ---> `orderInfo/ShippingState`  
  > - `returnReason` ---> `orderInfo/ReturnReason`  

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image077.png)

<!-- - Check that the `orderInfo` variable is mapped under **Variables**.  -->
**400.7.3:** Drag and drop a **Call REST Endpoint** unto the **`+`** icon under the assign

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image078.png)

**400.7.4:**

- Instead of dragging and dropping an element, paste the following snippet for the **Page** variable `responseCode` on the right:
  
  ```javascript
    {
    "response": "Failure"
    }
  ```

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image087.png)

- The final **Action Chain** should resemble as depicted below:

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image088.png)

## **400.8: Test the Web Application**

**400.8.1:** Return to the **Design** view

**400.8.2:** We can test the application in **Live** mode by clicking the _LIVE_ icon <img src="images/vbcs/400/image091_001.png" width="45px"> or by clicking the Play Button <img src="images/vbcs/400/image091_002.png" width="25px"> (**Run** icon) on the top right corner which opens the form in a new browser window

> - To test the application, we need to capture the response and display it somewhere so that we know what is happening behind the scenes (whether the REST endpoint was called, whether the call was successful or the call failed)  
>  - We can achieve this simply by using a **Text** component and setting the value of the component to the reponse payload from the web-service call.

**400.8.3:** Drag and drop a **Text** _Field Component_ on the page next to the button
> You can use the **Filter** option to find it quickly

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image089.png)

**400.8.4:** 
- Open up the expression builder 
- Set the **Value** property of the **Text** component to `responseCode/response`

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image090.png)

- Verify that the value is updated to `{{ $page.variables.responseCode.response }}`
- Test the app

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image090_001.png)

**400.8.5a:** 
- Play around the form and try entering various values
  - We suggest trying values that you know are incorrect and try leaving values empty values
    - You will be able to see the validations we created on the form fields are at play after tabbing out or after the form field loses focus

> ***NOTE :*** Enter a different **Order ID** every time you click on the **Submit Order** button so that the REST endpoint returns a valid value.

**400.8.5b:** Enter the following data in their respective fields and click on **Submit Order** 

  ```javascript
    Order ID      : 1
    Model         : Test
    Quantity      : 1
    Price         : 1000
    Ship To       : CO
    Return Reason : (Optional - any random text)
  ```

 > ***You can see the web-service (REST) call goes through and a status is returned such as `ORDER_SUSPENDED` or `ORDER_PROCESSED`***

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image092_002.png)

**400.8.5c:** Enter the following data in their respective fields and click on **Submit Order**
  ```javascript
    Order ID      : (blank)
    Model         : (blank)
    Quantity      : -100
    Price         : 100000
    Ship To       : (not selected/blank)
    Return Reason : (Optional - any random text)
  ```
  > ***You can see the web-service (REST) call goes through but no status is returned; the form validation is at play and the status of `Failure` that we set in the **Action Chain** is used and printed on the UI this time***

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image092_001.png)

  > In the next section, you will alter the flow so that the form is submitted only when all the form fields are validated

## **400.9: Add Client-Side Validation to the Form**

- First we have to set up our form to check the validity of its contents before submitting. We do this by surrounding the form with an _`<oj-validation-group>`_ element, adding a custom isFormValid Javascript function that returns a boolean, and then calling that function before submitting the form.

**400.9.1:** Click on the **Code** button and view the source code that has been generated

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image093.png)

**400.9.2:** Surround the form **div** with `<oj-validation-group id="orderForm">`

> ***NOTE:*** The page won't load because we haven't imported the `oj-validation-group` component. Switch to another translation of the **Code** by selecting the icon with the curly braces _`{ }`_

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image095.png)

**400.9.3:** Add the following highlighted section to the bottom of the imports section:
> ***NOTE:*** That since this is a JSON object, a **`,`** (comma) needs to be added to the line above
 
  ```javascript
    "oj-validation-group": {
        "path": "ojs/ojvalidationgroup"
      }
  ```

**400.9.4:** Click on the `shoppingportal` application on the left and click the **JS** icon to add Javascript. Add the following function:

  ```javascript
    AppModule.prototype.isFormValid = function(form) {
      var tracker = document.getElementById(form); 
      if (tracker.valid === "valid") {
        return true;
      } else {
        tracker.showMessages();
        tracker.focusOn("@firstInvalidShown");
        return false;
        }
    };
  ```

**400.9.5a:**  Change the **Action Chain** on button click
- Click on **Actions** 
- Click on **ButtonClickAction**

**400.9.5b:** Drag and drop an **If** logic item under **Logic** to the line below **Start**

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image099.png)

**400.9.5c:** Move the **Assign Variables orderInfo** onto the **`+`** icon under the **true** branch of the **If** logic item

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image100.png)

**400.9.5d:** Click on the **If** logic and set the **Condition** property to `{{ $application.functions.isFormValid("orderForm") }}`  
- This will call the form validation Javascript function that we previously wrote

**400.9.6:** 
- Run the form again by clicking the **Run** <img src="images/vbcs/400/image091_002.png" width="15px"> icon
- Click the **Submit Order** button without filling in any of the form fields and observe that the form does not get submitted this time and the REST endpoint will not be called

  ![](images/vbcs/400/image103.png)

**400.9.7:** Fill in the form fields and click **Submit Order** then verify that the REST endpoint is called successfully and a valid status is returned. If not, review the previous steps and try again
