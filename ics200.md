# Lab 200: Basic OIC Development (Hello World Integration)

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **OIC Integration Development** Workshop. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic 'hello world' echo service, using a basic orchestration. 

The OIC integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

![](images/200/image001a.png)

Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

Postman will be used to test the exposed REST API Service endpoint of the OIC integration called *UserXX Hello World* (where XX will be the Number assigned by the Instructor).  This integration has 1 connection.  The incoming message is received by the incoming *UserXX REST* REST Connection.  The integration flow will take the Input String and echo it back in the REST API response.

## Objectives

- Create your first integration to echo an input to the output 

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

### Login to OIC Integration Home Page

>***NOTE:*** the **User Name** and **Password** values will be given to you by your instructor. See _Lab 100 **1.1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud Account_ for more information on how to sign into the OIC home page

### **2.1.1** Create a REST Connection

In this first part of the lab, we will create a connection :

Letâ€™s start by logging into the Oracle Cloud account using your allocated user (demo.user1.10)  

>**NOTE:** All the screenshots use the _demo.user10_ account. Replace the _demo.user10_ with your assigned account to validate the steps illustrated in the screenshots. 

---

**2.1.1.1** Click on **Itegrations** tab followed by  the **Connection** section from designer page as shown below

![](images/200/image004.png)

**2.1.1.4** Fill in the information for the new connection 

- **Name** in the form of _UserXX REST_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.

**2.1.1.5** click **Create**

![](images/200/image006.png) 

>***Note*** The default security configuration is set to **Basic Authentication**, which by the way, is the only option available for REST trigger connections. When invoking the trigger, we will use our OIC username/password.

Testing the activated integration can be done using multiple tools and depends on your preference. See each relevant product's website on how to install the tool, if its required.

----

**2.4.1.1** Next `click on this endpoint url` it will take you to a new page where we will copy our endpoint URL to our your clipboard.

You have now completed Lab 200 of the OIC Developer Workshop. In the next lab, we are going to take a sample integration flow and add additional components to finish the flow.

- This Lab is now completed.
