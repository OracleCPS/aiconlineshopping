# Lab 700: API Management Lab, Add Online Shopping API to APIPCS 
## Introduction

In this Lab we are going to use APIPCS to add an API for Online Shopping REST API and secure the API using Policies.


About APIPCS:

The Oracle API Platform Cloud Service is a great API Management solution which supports agile API development, and also makes it easy to keep an eye on KPIs covering every aspect of the API lifecycle. True hybrid API deployment – in the Cloud or on-premises – means that your API solution is modern and adaptable, all while employing the most up-to-date security protocols.

### Login to APIPCS Home Page

### Creating an API Proxy

Now you’ll create a proxy for your API. To create an API:

From the APIs tab, click Create API.

![](images/700/img02.png)

 Enter the unique name of your resource  into the API Name field. 

 Enter 1 in the Version field.

(Optional) Populate the description field in this form as you would like.

![](images/700/img03.png)

Click Create.

### Configure the API Request

The API request is the endpoint to which requests for your API are sent when it is deployed to a gateway.

To configure the API Request:

 From the APIs page, click the API you created in the previous task.

 From left menu item click **Specification** tab as shown 

 ![](images/700/img05.png)

 Hover over the API Request policy, and then click Edit.

 ![](images/700/img06.png)

On the Apply Policy Dialog, complete these fields:

Select HTTPS from the Protocol list. This is the protocol on which the gateway receives requests for this API.

Enter name of your resource in lower case,  into the API Endpoint URL field.

![](images/700/img07.png)

Click Apply.

### Configure the Service Request

The service request is the URL at which your backend service receives requests. When a request meets all policy conditions, the gateway routes the request to this URL and calls your service.

The service request URL can point to any of your service’s resources, not just its base URL. This way you can restrict users to access only a subset of your API’s resources.

To configure the service request:

Hover over the Service Request policy, and then click Edit.

![](images/700/img08.png)

On the Apply Policy Dialog, complete these fields:

Paste the mock server value you copied at the end of Lab 300 (which should resemble https://ICS URL/integration/flowapi/ic/api/integration/v1/flows/rest/ONLINE_SHOPPING_APP/1.0/orders) into the Backend Service URL field.

Add the Service Account which stores the credentials to log into Oracle OICS

![](images/700/img11.png)

Click Apply.

![](images/700/img12.png)

Click Save Changes

### Deploy API to the API Gateway

After creating the API, adding the API Request and Service Request. In this section you will deploy the API to an API Gateway so that it receives requests at the endpoint you configured and routes successful requests to the service you created with Oracle OICS in Lab 300.

To perform the same from main menu click on deployments tab 

![](images/700/img13.png)

A new page comes up .From here click **Deploy API**

![](images/700/img14.png)

Here you will see a list of Deployment Gateways available with APIPCS.Select one of them and click **Deploy**

![](images/700/img15.png)

Wait for the deployment to complete (the page refreshes automatically). The deployment is complete when your API displays on the Deployed tab.

![](images/700/img22.png)

Copy the URL that appears in the Load Balancer URL section. This is the endpoint clients use to send requests to your proxy API on the gateway.

The URL should look something like this: 
http://devgateway.mobiledemo.mobi:8011/onlineshopapproval

![](images/700/img22.png)

### Test API

To test the  integration, we will use Postman installed during the pre-requisite section. Postman will now call APIPCS for the API and if successful, send the request to OICS for processing

![](images/700/img23.png)

On the New Tab page, enter the following information

 Change the GET to POST
URL : http://devgateway.mobiledemo.mobi:8011/onlineshopapproval

![](images/700/img24.png)

Select Headers tab to add the following headers to the request

-Content-Type : application\json

-icsHeader : Value Passed by Postman Through APIPCS

![](images/700/img55.png)

Click **Send** to test Application

Go to the bottom of the page.You will see same  response as tested previously with OICS url.

![](images/700/img56.png)

### Add Key Validation Policy

In this part of the lab, you’ll add a validation policy to your API to ensure that Application Developers consuming it have registered it to an application, the application is registered, and a current, valid application key is used.

To configure the key validation policy:

Back in the Management Portal, click the API Implementation tab.

In the Available Policies section, expand Security, hover over Key Validation, and then click Apply as shown

![](images/700/img26.png)

On the Apply Policy Dialog, complete these fields:

(Optional) Complete the name and description fields as you would like.

Ensure that API Request is selected from the Place Policy After list, and then click Next.

![](images/700/img27.png)


Click the Header tab.

Enter the text app-key into the Header field. The application key must be sent in a header named app-key for the request to be passed to the next policy or to the service request endpoint.

Click Apply.

![](images/700/img28.png)

Note that the new "Key Validation" policy will show up in the Request pipeline.

Click the Save Changes button

![](images/700/img29.png)

### Add an Replication Rate Policy

Follow this task to add an application rate limiting policy. Application rate limiting policies are used to control how many requests are routed to an API from each application during a given period. If this threshold is exceeded, the gateway rejects subsequent requests from that application during this period.

To configure the application rate limiting policy:

In the Available Policies section, collapse Security (if it's still expanded), then expand the Traffic Management policies

Hover over Application Rate Limiting, and then click Apply.

![](images/700/img30.png)

Note: Make sure you’ve added the Application Rate Limiting policy, not the API Rate Limit policy. These policies behave differently; if you use the wrong one you may experience results different than those described in this document.

On the Apply Policy Dialog, complete these fields:

(Optional) Complete the name and description fields as you would like.

Ensure that Key Validation is selected from the Place Policy After list.

Click Next

![](images/700/img32.png)

Enter a number between 1 and 10 into the Rate Limit Per Application field. This is the number of requests that will be passed during each time interval.

Select Minute from the Time Interval list.

You can add additional conditions. This is useful if you want to limit the number

![](images/700/img33.png)

Note that the new "Application Rate Limiting" policy will show up in the Request pipeline.

Click the Save Changes button.

![](images/700/img34.png)

### Re-deploy API to the API Gateway

After adding policies to the API, we will now re-deploy the API to API Gateway so that it can enforce them as it receives requests at the endpoint you configured in Lab 200.

To re-deploy the API:

Click the Deployments tab.

![](images/700/img35.png)

Click on the Redeploy button, then the Latest Iteration button that will appear.

![](images/700/img36.png)

You will prompted at the top that you are sure you want to redeploy. Optionally enter a comment, then select the Yes button.

![](images/700/img37.png)

The Redeploy Request message will be seen, then the request is put in the Waiting state .After waiting for the API Gateway to poll the API Management Server, the API Deployment will be promoted to the Deployed state again.

 As was done in Lab 200, copy the URL that appears in the Load Balancer URL section.

 The URL should look something like this: 

 http://devgateway.mobiledemo.mobi:8011/onlineshopapproval

![](images/700/img38.png)

###  Initial Re-Test of the API with Policies

1.4.1 (Pre-Req) Follow the steps in previous sections again to setup the Postman API Test. This should still be setup in your Postman instance unless it was closed.

1.4.1 Select the Send button again in Postman to query the API.

Note that the API will not work anymore because there is no application key passed in the header. The Key Validation policy enforcement returned a 401 Unauthorized error.

![](images/700/img39.png)

What we need to do now is get an API Key. The API Key is obtained by registering an Application against our API. The next section will step you through the Application setup and registration against the API.

### Application Creation And Registration

One of the requirements for your API is that all calling applications be registered in order to be able to call the API. The calling application has to be registered to the API and will have to pass the appropriate identifying header value.

Perform Below mentioned activities:

Now go back to Oracle API Cloud Service and from left under list of menu items click on **Plan** tab 

![](images/700/img39_1.png)

Click on the Redeploy button, then the Latest Iteration button that will appear,select the same and Click **Yes** to finish this task.

![](images/700/img43_8.png)

### Final Re-Test of the API with Policies

Add the api-key header to the Postman request using the App Key that was copied in the last step from the APIPCS Applications tab.

![](images/700/img44.png)

Note that the status of 200 should now be received by the API request.

![](images/700/img53.png)

![](images/700/img56.png)

Next, select the Send button enough times in order to exceed your Rate Limiting API policy that was added. Once that policy is exceeded, you will receive a 403 Forbidden status response for the API call on Postman.
